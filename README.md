## //You there! ðŸ‘‹

Call me IYX, although I can go by IYANN. 

## //About me
<img align="left" src="https://media.tenor.com/images/bbe2e72ce059f349e925f1bf95057eea/tenor.gif">
My main expertise revolves around 3D Modeling, Content Writing and Graphic designing. I do have a background in Programming and more or less comfortable working around Unity Game Development, Discord Bot Development(JS), and Front-End Web Development. I also love to manage game servers where I can modify existing codes and databases to achieve what the server needs along with my knowledge of modifying custom 3D Assets. (GTA, Roblox, Minecraft, etc)
